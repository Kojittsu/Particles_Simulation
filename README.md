## 📐 Explicit Euler for Particle Dynamics Resolution

In this particle simulation, the explicit Euler method is employed to resolve particle dynamics. This method is a numerical approach for solving first-order ordinary differential equations, such as those describing particle motion in our simulated universe.\
For more details see [Euler method Wiki Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method).

In our case, the formula for updating the position and velocity of particles using the explicit Euler method can be expressed as follows:\
For velocity : `newVelocity = currentVelocity + acceleration * deltaTime`\
For position : `newPosition = currentPosition + velocity * deltaTime`\
Where `deltaTime` is the size of the time step used in the simulation.

The explicit Euler method is simple to implement but can introduce approximation errors. More advanced numerical methods, such as Runge-Kutta methods or Verlet integration, can be employed to obtain more accurate results in certain cases.

## 📚 Features

- Particle initialization :
  - Particles are initialized with different parameters, acceleration is set to zero.

- Random particles initialization :
  - Random particles are initialized with different parameters.
  - Position is randomly set in the box.
  - Velocity is randomly set in [-maxVelocity, maxVelocity] for each components.
  - Radius is randomly set in [minRadius, maxRadius].
  - Mass is randomly set in [minMass, maxMass].
  - Acceleration is set to globalAcceleration.
  - Color is randomly set.
  - Name is empty.

- Universe initialization :
  - Universe is initialized with different parameters.

- Universe simulation :
  - Particle-particle collisions
  - Particle-box collisions.
  - Global acceleration set to all particles.
  - Energy restitution must be set in [0,1], 0 mean all energy is loss, 1 mean energy conservation.

- Universe rendering :
  - Create a window that display universe simulation using OpenGL.
  - Simulation speed is set to a speed factor (1 mean real time simulation).
  - Display simulation time in runtime.

- Graphical user interface :
  - Control the simulation through a graphical interface using [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)

- Miscellaneous :
  - A datafile name can be set to save particles motions over time.
