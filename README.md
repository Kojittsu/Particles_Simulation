This project is a particle simulation using the C++ programming language. It models the interaction of particles in a 3D universe and render it using the the [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) library.

## üìê Explicit Euler for Particle Dynamics Resolution

In this particle simulation, the explicit Euler method is employed to resolve particle dynamics. This method is a numerical approach for solving first-order ordinary differential equations, such as those describing particle motion in our simulated universe.\
For more details see [Euler method Wiki Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method).

In our case, the formula for updating the position and velocity of particles using the explicit Euler method can be expressed as follows:\
For velocity : `newVelocity = currentVelocity + acceleration * deltaTime`\
For position : `newPosition = currentPosition + velocity * deltaTime`\
Where `deltaTime` is the size of the time step used in the simulation.

The explicit Euler method is simple to implement but can introduce approximation errors. More advanced numerical methods, such as Runge-Kutta methods or Verlet integration, can be employed to obtain more accurate results in certain cases.

## üìö Features

- Particle initialization :
  - Particles are initialized with different parameters, acceleration is set to zero.

- Universe initialization :
  - Universe is initialized with different parameters.

- Universe simulation :
  - Particle-particle collisions
  - Particle-boxes collisions.
  - Global acceleration set to all particles.
  - Energy restitution must be set in [0.0, 1.0], 0.0 mean all energy is loss, 1.0 mean energy conservation.

- Universe rendering :
  - Create a window that display universe simulation using GLFW.
  - Simulation speed is set by a speed factor (1.0 mean real time simulation).
  - Rendering is scale up/down by a scale factor (1.0 mean that 1 meter is 1 scene unit).
  - Graphical user interface :
    - Control the simulation through a graphical interface using the [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) library.
    - Usage of the [ImPlot](https://github.com/epezent/implot) library for graphs rendering.

- Miscellaneous :
  - A datafile name can be set to save particles motions over time.

## üìù Configuration file
